  <h3> The beginning </h3>
  <p> To go a little more in depth about myself and poersonality, I will give a recap of how my early life began. I was born in Hayward California on January 11, 2004, however I always lived in Newark. I grew up in a family who tried to give me thei best no matter what, and encourage me to find something I love. So as a yuong girl I would love reading books. At the age of 5 i loved doing simple math books! Now you might question what my favorite books were as an elementary student, so here it it!</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Red Queen</li>
  <li>Harry Potter</li>
  <li>The Unfortunate Events</li>
  <li>Lord of the rings</li>
  <li>Glass of Throne</li>
  <p> These books inspired me in so many ways, that have shaped me into the person I am today. They taught me:
  <ul>
  <li> Perserverance</li>
  <li>Determination</li>
  <li>Confidence</li>
  <li>Positivity</li>
  <li>Kindness</li>
</ol>
<b>Sports</b>
<p>Sports have had an impactful meaning in my life for various of reasons!
